Read @README.md for details

## Working principles

- You should work step-by-step and phase-by-phase without any breaks
- Only stop if there's a critical decision to make (moving to the next phase isn't a critical decision)
- Remember to review your work twice before moving to the next phase

## Check list

- Ensure all scripts are Bash 3.2 compatible
- Ensure documents are up-to-date

## Documentation principles

- Maintainability: Won't need updates when adding/removing scripts
- Self-documenting: The rules explain themselves
- Developer-friendly: Clear guidance on where new code belongs
- Concise: Reduced lines as many as possible while being more informative
- Principle-based: Teaches the "why" not just the "what"
