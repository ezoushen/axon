Read @README.md

- Ensure all scripts are Bash 3.2 compatible
- You should work step-by-step and phase-by-phase without any break, you can only stop while there's any critical decision to make (move to next phase is not a critical decision). But remember to review your works twice before move to the next phase.

## Documentation principles

- Maintainability: Won't need updates when adding/removing scripts
- Self-documenting: The rules explain themselves
- Developer-friendly: Clear guidance on where new code belongs
- Concise: Reduced lines as many as possible while being more informative
- Principle-based: Teaches the "why" not just the "what"
